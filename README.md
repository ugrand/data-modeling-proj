Creating a complete data modeling project in Python involves several steps, including data preparation, feature selection, choosing a model, training, and evaluating the model. For this example, let's create a simple project using the popular Scikit-learn library to model the Iris dataset. This dataset is ideal for beginners.
Creating a complete data modeling project in Python involves several steps, including data preparation, feature selection, choosing a model, training, and evaluating the model. For this example, let's create a simple project using the popular Scikit-learn library to model the Iris dataset. This dataset is ideal for beginners due to its simplicity and small size.

First, make sure you have the necessary libraries installed:
Explanation of the Code:
Import Libraries: Necessary libraries and modules are imported.

Load Dataset: The Iris dataset is loaded from Scikit-learn.

Split Dataset: The dataset is split into training and test sets.

Feature Scaling: Standardization of datasets is a common requirement for many machine learning estimators in scikit-learn; they might behave badly if the individual features do not more or less look like standard normally distributed data (e.g., Gaussian with 0 mean and unit variance).

Model Creation and Training: A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier is created and trained on the training data.

Model Prediction: The model is used to make predictions on the test data.

Model Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using a confusion matrix, a classification report, and the accuracy score.

Plotting: A heatmap of the confusion matrix is plotted for a better visual understanding.

Note: # Import libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix, accuracy_score

# Load dataset
iris = datasets.load_iris()
X = iris.data
y = iris.target

# Split dataset into training set and test set
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)  # 70% training and 30% testing

# Feature Scaling
scaler = StandardScaler()
scaler.fit(X_train)

X_train = scaler.transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Create KNN Classifier
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5)

# Train the model using the training sets
knn.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict the response for test dataset
y_pred = knn.predict(X_test)

# Model Evaluation
print("Confusion Matrix:\n", confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
print("\nClassification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
print("Accuracy Score:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))

# Plotting confusion matrix
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.heatmap(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred), annot=True)
plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
plt.ylabel('Actual Label')
plt.xlabel('Predicted Label')
plt.show()
